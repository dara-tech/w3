# ‚ö†Ô∏è MAINNET DEPLOYMENT WARNING

**BEFORE DEPLOYING TO ETHEREUM MAINNET, READ THIS CAREFULLY!**

## ‚õî CRITICAL WARNINGS

### 1. **This is NOT Real USDT!**
This is a **EDUCATIONAL/EXPERIMENTAL** project that mints tokens with no real value. 
- It uses the name "Tether USD" and symbol "USDT" but has **NO backing**
- It is **NOT** the real Tether USDT token
- Deploying this to mainnet could be **MISLEADING** and **HARMFUL** to users

### 2. **Legal Issues**
- Using the "USDT" trademark on mainnet could result in **legal action** from Tether
- This could be considered trademark infringement
- You could face significant legal consequences

### 3. **User Deception Risk**
- Users might think they're receiving real USDT
- This could lead to fraud allegations
- Could damage your reputation permanently

### 4. **Real Money at Risk**
- Mainnet deployments cost **real ETH** (gas fees)
- You cannot undo a deployment on mainnet
- Transactions are permanent and immutable

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES

### Option 1: Change the Token Name
```solidity
// In FlashToken.sol, change from:
FlashToken.deploy("Tether USD", "USDT");

// To something like:
FlashToken.deploy("Test USD Token", "TUSD");
// OR
FlashToken.deploy("Demo Stablecoin", "DEMO");
```

### Option 2: Use Testnets Only
Keep deployments on **Sepolia** or **Holesky** testnets where:
- No real money is involved
- Safe for experimentation
- No legal concerns

### Option 3: Create Original Token
Create a completely original token concept with:
- Unique name and symbol
- Clear documentation about its purpose
- Proper legal review

## üìù IF YOU STILL WANT TO DEPLOY

If you understand all risks and still want to proceed:

1. **Update contract name** to something original
2. **Update symbol** to avoid trademark issues
3. **Add clear warnings** in your frontend
4. **Get legal advice** first
5. **Start with a small amount** of ETH for testing
6. **Have rollback plan** ready

## üö® WHEN TO DEPLOY TO MAINNET

Only deploy to mainnet if:
- ‚úÖ You've changed the name and symbol to be original
- ‚úÖ You have legal clearance
- ‚úÖ You understand all risks
- ‚úÖ You have a real use case
- ‚úÖ You're prepared for consequences

## üìû Questions?

If you're unsure, **DON'T DEPLOY TO MAINNET**. Test on testnets first and consult with legal and technical advisors.
